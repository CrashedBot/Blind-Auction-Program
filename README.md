# Blind Auction Program

The Blind Auction Program is a Python-based command-line application that allows users to conduct blind auctions. It enables participants to anonymously submit their bids for a particular item or service, without knowing the bids of other participants. At the end of the auction, the program reveals the highest bidder and their bid.

## Features

- Anonymous bidding: Participants can submit their bids without knowing the bids of others.
- Secure bidding: The bids are stored in a secure manner, ensuring the anonymity and confidentiality of participants.
- Real-time updates: The program provides real-time updates on the current highest bid during the auction.
- Bid validation: The program validates the input bids to ensure they are in the correct format.
- Flexible auction duration: The user can specify the duration of the auction.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

### Setup

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install art
   ```

2. Open the `blind_auction.py` file in a text editor of your choice.

3. Save the changes and close the file.

### Running the Program

1. In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the following command to execute the program:

   ```
   python blind_auction.py
   ```

3. The program will display the program logo and prompt you to enter your bid. Follow the instructions provided and enter your bid accordingly.

4. Once you have entered your bid, the program will ask if there are any remaining bidders. Enter "yes" if there are more bidders, or "no" if there are no more bidders.

5. If there are more bidders, the program will clear the screen and prompt the next bidder to enter their bid.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for each bidder until there are no more bidders.

7. After the last bidder has entered their bid, the program will determine the highest bidder and display their name and bid.
